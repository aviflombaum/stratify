<div class="description">
  <p>An iTunes collector pulls in your latest iTunes activity from an "iTunes Music Library.xml" file.  On OS X, this file typically resides at <code>~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml</code>. To create an iTunes collector, provide the location of your iTunes XML file.</p>

  <p>To pull in activity from a local iTunes library, just provide the file path, and you're all set.  For example:</p>
  
  <p><code>/Users/johndoe/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music Library.xml</code></p>

  <p>You can also pull in activity from an iTunes XML file at a remote location.  To do so, just provide a URL that points to the file.  A few examples:</p>

  <p><code>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1234567/iTunes%20Music%20Library.xml</code></p>

  <p><code>ftp://username:password@LivingRoomMacMini.local/Music/iTunes/iTunes%20Music%20Library.xml</code></p>

<div class="field">
  <%= f.label :library_path, "Location of 'iTunes Music Library.xml' file" %><br />
  <%= f.text_field :library_path %>
</div>
